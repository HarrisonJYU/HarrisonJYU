 ðŸ‘‹ __Hi there__! 
 
My name is Harrison. I work with AI, data, and code on improving our physical world. I build stuff, mostly quantitative, sometimes qualitative. Most projects you will find here are to learn something I didn't know before, to build something that would be helpful for others, or sometimes to visualize interesting stories of physical world.  
 
 ðŸ“Š Current Data Scientist ðŸŒƒ Former Urban planner 
 
 ðŸŒ± Intrigued by all kinds of interactions, among humans, agents, nodes or sensors.
