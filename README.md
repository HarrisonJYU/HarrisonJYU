 ðŸ‘‹ __Hi there__! 
 
My name is Harrison. I work on improving user experiences of our physical world, with AI and Data. I code on stuff, mostly quantitative, sometimes qualitative. Most projects you will find here are to learn something I didn't know before, to build something that would be helpful for others, and sometimes to capture essense of our times through .  
 
 ðŸ“ˆ Current Data Scientist ðŸŒƒ Former Urban planner
